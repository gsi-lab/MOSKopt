# MOSKopt
Process simulation-based design space optimizer with embedded Monte Carlo-based uncertainty quantification.

MOSKopt is a MATLAB-based simulation-based optimizer and is part of a larger computational framework developed for performing design space optimization under uncertainty in the following paper. 

**Stochastic simulation-based superstructure optimization framework for process synthesis and design under uncertainty**

### Installing MOSKopt
Downloading and adding the folder path to your current MATLAB session will suffice to make use of the full functionality of the optimizer. Alternatively, you can also run **install.m** file in your MATLAB session.
