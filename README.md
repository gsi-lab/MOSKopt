# MOSKopt
Process simulation-based design space optimizer with embedded Monte Carlo-based uncertainty quantification.

MOSKopt is a MATLAB-based simulation-based optimizer developed for performing design space optimization under uncertainty in the following paper. 

[**Stochastic simulation-based superstructure optimization framework for process synthesis and design under uncertainty**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2020.107118)  

### Installing MOSKopt
Downloading and adding the folder path to your current MATLAB session will suffice to make use of the full functionality of the optimizer. Alternatively, you can also run **install.m** file in your MATLAB session.
